## Attendance Logging

- Logs three types of events:
  - `appeared`: Student(s) detected entering the frame.
  - `disappeared`: Student(s) leaving the frame.
  - `change`: Any change in student count.
- Only tracks the last 10 events for easy monitoring.
- Timestamped for accurate attendance tracking.

---

## Insights Panel

Displays real-time metrics including:

- **FPS:** Frames per second of detection loop.
- **Average Count:** Average number of students detected over recent frames.
- **Status:** Camera status indicator (active/inactive).
- **Attendance Log:** Shows recent attendance events if Attendance Mode is active.

---

## Future Improvements

- Integrate with a **backend database** for persistent attendance records.
- Add **student identification** using facial recognition for automatic roll call.
- Support multiple classrooms with user authentication.
- Export attendance logs as **CSV or PDF**.
- Add advanced analytics and charts for attendance trends.
